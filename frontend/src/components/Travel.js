          Organize a trip to New Zealand: budget
          Normally when we write this type of organizational
          post we donâ€™t include this section, but in the case of
          New Zealand, we thought it was important.
          Because New Zealand is an expensive trip, and you have
          to be clear about that before you start organizing so
          you donâ€™t get any surprises when itâ€™s already late.
          We did a 21-day camper route and spent about 4,600 euros per person.
